# HastyDots

A first cut attempt at making a TwoDots app but without annoying videos

# TODO:

impliment the square detection
impliment block removal - with stable and unstable states
abstract the fmt.print debuging - done
abstract the rendering to a string - done
robustify level creation - protect against to big and too small levels and bad data - done (somewhat!)
